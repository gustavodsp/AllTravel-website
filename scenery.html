          <p>The world's largest salt flats, spanning 4086 miles (10,582 sq. km), Salar de Uyuni is unlike anywhere else on earth. 
		  This awe-inspiring landscape is comprised of glistening white salt, and is completely flat creating the mesmerising reflections.
		  The Salar was formed as a result of transformations between several prehistoric lakes. 
		  It is covered by a few meters of salt crust, which has an extraordinary flatness with the average elevation variations within one meter over the entire area of the Salar. 
		  The crust serves as a source of salt and covers a pool of brine, which is exceptionally rich in lithium. It contains 50% to 70% of the world's known lithium reserves</p>

          <p>Moraine Lake may only be half the size of its nearby neighbour Lake Louise, but it's even more scenic. 
		  Situated in the beautiful Valley Of The Ten Peaks in Banff National Park, this glacier-fed lake turns the most intense and vivid shade of turquoise blue. 
		  The setting of the surrounding majestic mountain peaks makes the scene almost surreal.
		  It does not reach its crest until mid to late June. When it is full, it reflects a distinctive shade of azure blue. 
		  The unique colour is due to the refraction of light off the rock flour deposited in the lake on a continual basis by surrounding glaciers.</p>

          <p>One of the modern natural wonders of the world, this chain of mini waterfalls is one of the planet's most awe-inspiring sights. 
		  A visit is an awe-inspiring visceral experience, and the power and noise of the cascades – a chain of hundreds of waterfalls nearly 3km in extension – is something you won't forget. 
		  The falls lie split between Brazil and Argentina in a large expanse of national park, much of it rainforest teeming with unique flora and fauna.
		  The name "Iguazú" comes from the Guarani or Tupi words "y" [ɨ], meaning "water", and "ûasú "[waˈsu], meaning "big".
		  Legend has it that a deity planned to marry a beautiful woman named Naipí, who fled with her mortal lover Tarobá in a canoe. 
		  In a rage, the deity sliced the river, creating the waterfalls and condemning the lovers to an eternal fall.</p>

          <p>This incredible waterfall, along Iceland's southern coast, is fed by melting water from the famed glacier-capped Eyjafjallajokull volcano. 
		  This powerful waterfall cascades into a pretty meadow but is best known for the walking path that runs behind the curtain of water where visitors can enjoy a truly unique viewpoint.
		  One important tip for people who pretend to visit it is that during winter, the path that leads behind the cascade gets covered by ice and huge icicles grow from the rock face. 
		  Due to the unsafe conditions, the path becomes inaccessible. Please respect the closure and don’t step on the path when it is closed.</p>
